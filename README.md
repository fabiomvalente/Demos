## 📌 About This Repository
Welcome to my demo repository! Here you will find practical, structured examples demonstrating real-world concepts I've used in training, prototyping, or production proof-of-concepts.  
As a **Solution Architect and Senior Developer**, I explore system integration, automation, data manipulation, and more.
